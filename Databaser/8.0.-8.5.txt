Jeg er ikke helt sikker på hvordan jeg skal forstå opgaven, jeg har løst den ud fra at jeg skal 
give rows et number i form af rank og grupper language og printet dem ud. Me jeg får Danish til 
rank 152 hvilket ikke er korrekt iflg dit resultat. 

set @rank=0;
select @rank:=@rank+1 as Rank, countrylanguage.language as 'Spoken language'

from country
join countrylanguage on countrycode = code
